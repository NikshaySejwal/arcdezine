    description: `<br>We are proud to present Commercial/ Shopping Mall, a modern commercial complex designed and executed by our team in the heart of Rewari. Spread across a 1500 sq. yard plot area, this project blends functionality with aesthetic appeal, offering a dynamic shopping and business destination.
    Project Overview:The design concept focuses on creating a vibrant commercial hub catering to both retail and office spaces. The Ground and First Floors have been dedicated entirely to retail shopping outlets, ensuring high footfall and an active commercial environment. The upper floors serve as corporate office spaces, providing a professional atmosphere with excellent visibility and accessibility.
    
<br>Key Design Highlights:

<br>Façade Design:
<br>The exterior is clad with premium ACP (Aluminium Composite Panel) material, giving the mall a sleek, contemporary, and low-maintenance finish. The clean lines and geometric façade patterns create a bold urban identity.

<br>Escalator as a Design Element:
One of the standout features of the mall is the front façade escalator. Strategically placed, it not only enhances accessibility to the upper shopping floors but also serves as a visual design statement, drawing customer attention and adding movement and life to the frontage.

<br>Basement Parking with Rear Entry:
<br>Understanding the need for efficient traffic management, the basement has been dedicated to parking, accessible through a rear entry point. This ensures smooth vehicular circulation and keeps the front pedestrian-friendly.

<br>Integrated Retail and Office Spaces:
<br>With retail on the lower levels and office spaces above, the design supports a diverse tenant mix, making the complex a one-stop commercial destination for both shoppers and businesses.

<br>Lighting and Ambience:
<br>A carefully planned lighting strategy ensures the building maintains its visual appeal both during the day and at night. The backlit ACP elements and illuminated escalator area create a vibrant and welcoming ambiance after sunset.`,

    description: `<br>Step into timeless elegance at the all-new Raghuram Jewellers showroom in Gurugram, a thoughtfully curated extension of their legacy after their flagship stores in Pitampura, Delhi.

<br>Spread across two floors, the showroom is a blend of modern opulence and artisanal detailing, with a dedicated jewellery display area, private consultation zones, and an office + back-end workspace on the first floor.

<br>To seamlessly connect both levels, we introduced a custom-designed spiral staircase, adding sculptural drama while enhancing customer flow and visual connection between floors.

<br>The interior palette is dominated by soft rose gold tones, muted beiges, and warm lighting, highlighting the jewellery pieces like art on display. From mirror-finished ceiling lights, curved counters, backlit arched niches, to bespoke marble flooring, every element reflects sophistication and grandeur.

<br>This design language ensures that each visitor's journey is immersive, making the jewellery buying experience personal, memorable, and inspiring.
After establishing a strong presence in Pitampura, Delhi, Raghuram Jewellers envisioned their next milestone – a luxury showroom in Gurugram, designed to reflect their evolving identity while retaining their legacy charm.

<br>Design Vision:

<br>The brief was simple yet ambitious:
<br>“Create a modern, experiential space that elevates the jewellery buying journey while staying rooted in elegance and trust.”

We conceptualized a rose gold themed showroom, blending contemporary aesthetics with timeless luxury.

<br>The showroom spans two floors, carefully zoned to optimize customer experience and staff functionality.

<br>Ground Floor:

<br>Main Display Area with individual jewellery sections for Necklaces, Rings, Earrings, and Bridal Collections.

A stunning spiral staircase as a central sculptural element, visually connecting both floors.


First Floor:

<br>Office space, inventory area, and back-end working zones for staff and operations.

Additional seating and consultation lounges.



<br>Design Highlights:

<br>Color Palette: Soft beige and muted champagne tones paired with rose gold trims and mirror finishes.

<br>Lighting: Layered lighting concept with backlit arches, accent spotlights, and statement ceiling chandeliers for a luxurious glow on display pieces.

<br>Flooring: Premium grey marble flooring with high gloss finish reflecting the ambient light beautifully.

<br>Display Design: Custom arched wall niches, floating counters, and glass-top display tables designed for maximum visibility and aesthetic appeal.

<br>Ceiling Feature: Circular mirror panels with hanging crystal chandeliers add volume and drama to the interior ceiling scape.
